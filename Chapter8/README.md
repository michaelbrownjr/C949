# Chapter 8 Lists and Dictionaries: Notes
### Lists
    * one of the most important object types in python
    * also known as a container which is an object that groups related objects together.
    * contained objects maintain left-to-right ordering items in the list are accessed via indexing operations
    * each element in a list can be differe type such as strings, integers, floats, or lists
    *list() creates an iterable object such as string list or tuple and returns a new list object
    * to copy a list, you must use the ":"
        * for example: your_teams = my_teams[:]

    split() -- places strings into a list that are separated by a space
    len() -- gets the number of items in the list
    enumerate() -- results in variables being a index and value
        for example -- for pos, value in enumerate(nums)
